<h2 id="language-and-speakers">The language and its speakers</h2>

Nen is a language spoken in the Morehead District of Western Province, Papua New Guinea. It is not to be confused with another language of the same name, the Southern Bantoid Nen of Cameroon. Around 400 people speak the language. Most live in the village of Bimadbn (also spelled Bimadeben), but as a result of intermarriage with neighbouring groups many speakers are to be found in neighbouring villages, particularly Dimsisi (to the east – dominant language Idi) and Govav (Gopap in Nen, Gubam in map spellings) to the west. A few dozen speakers reside in the provincial capital, Daru, and the national capital, Port Moresby.

The language name Nen is the word for ‘what’, based on a standard practice in Southern New Guinea of naming languages after their word for ‘what’ (Evans 2012a). Other names used for the language are _Nen zi_ ‘Nen language’, _Nen ym_ ‘what is it?’ and _Äkämär zi_  ‘Äkämär language’, where _Äkämär_ is the name of the tribe associated with the Nen language. (An important early ethnography of the region, Williams (1936:30), transcribes the tribal name as _Wekamara_). Nen belongs to the Nambu branch of the language family known as Yam (Evans 2009, Evans et al 2018), or Morehead-Wasur (Glottolog). Earlier classifications, such as Ross (2005), included the Yam languages plus the Pahoturi River and Eastern Trans-Fly languages in a larger family, Trans-Fly, but the evidence for that larger unit is weak.

The village of Bimadbn itself, with a population of around 350, is highly multilingual, with over ten languages present, and most individuals living there speak two or more languages fluently, with a typical portfolio of local languages being Nen, Nmbo and Idi. In earlier times the dominant lingua franca was Hiri Motu, still known by people of middle age or above. Today English is the dominant outside language, but it will normallyonly be used with people from outside the immediate district – with those from the Morehead district the use of local languages would be normal, even if the conversation proceeds in an asymmetric way (e.g. one person speaking Nen and the other replying in Nmbo). Tok Pisin is beginning to appear in limited domains, such as church dealings, joking, and interactions with Papua New Guineans from further afield. All children growing up in the village learn Nen fluently and, apart from its small speaker base, the language is currently quite secure – the statement in Glottolog that it is ‘definitively endangered’ is completely off the mark. In principle it is used, in a transitional way, in the Elementary School, alongside English, but the lack of written materials and general problems with the schooling system mean that children receive little formal exposure to it, though their teachers mainly use Nen (with some English) in talking to them in Elementary School. Subsequent schooling in the village nominally takes place in English, partly because some of the teachers come from elsewhere (e.g. the Sepik) and a number of children from other villages and languages board in the village for their post-elementary education up to Year 8.

Literacy in the language is limited to a few individuals – and literacy in general is rather limited, with many people unable to read and write at all, and others primarily limited in their literacy skills to reading well-known passages from the Bible, sending text messages by phone, or reading noticeboards. When I began work on the language in 2008 there was a provisional orthography designed by the SIL linguists Marco and René Boevé, who had primarily been working on Arammba, a distantly related Yam language of the Tonda branch. I was shown a small reader with a few words illustrating each letter or letter combination. Words written with this orthography were also written on blackboards in the Elementary School. Over the next two years this orthography was revised somewhat (see below) and has since stabilised to that used here. Following community request, some portions of the Bible have now been translated into Nen, and at Sunday services readings from these portions of the Nen Bible are carried out. Around ten people have sufficient literacy skills to do this, based on solid rehearsal of the reading passages. A smaller number, such as Jimmy Nébni, Nébni Mkao and Goe Dibod, who have been intimately involved in language work and transcription, have a more confident command of the writing system, including the ability to transcribe accurately using ELAN in Jimmy Nébni’s case. It is hoped that the availability of this dictionary in a form that can be accessed by the Nen diaspora will help promote literacy skills. The link will be announced through Facebook, which is gaining in popularity among Nen speakers.

**Map**: Languages of the Yam family.

There are around twenty-five languages in the Yam family, depending how one draws the boundary between language and dialect. So far there is no dictionary of any Yam language (though Siegel has a forthcoming dictionary of Nama). Recent work on the languages of this family has resulted in dissertation grammars of Komnzo (Döhler 2016, revised version published as Döhler 2018), Ngkolmpu (Carroll 2017), dissertation treatments of more specific topics such as split  intransitivity in Ranmo (Lee 2016) and sociolinguistic variation in Nmbo (Kashima in prep.), a detailed survey article of the languages of Southern New Guinea that includes nearly 40 pages on the Yam languages (Evans et al 2018:678-697, 744-761), and a number of articles on grammatical issues including Siegel (2014) on Nama tense and aspect, and Evans (2009, 2012b, 2014, 2015a,b, 2017) and Evans & Miller (2016) on various aspects of Nen. Before I began my fieldwork on Nen in 2008 there was next to no documentation on the language, aside from the brief spelling guide by Boevé & Boevé (2000) and some brief and inaccurate word lists compiled around the opening decades of the twentieth century (see Evans et al 2018:683-4 for references and evaluation of the transcriptions against modern Nen forms). There was somewhat better documentation of the anthropology of the region just to the west (with peripheral mentions of Nen), including the classic ethnography by Williams (1936) of the Nmbo-speaking Keraki tribe immediately to the west of Nen, the insightful PhD thesis on social structure and relations to land among the people of Rouku, by Ayres (1983), who incidentally was the first to make sound recordings of Nen speakers<a href="#ref1" id="1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="In 1981 Ayres recorded two Nen women, Dgma Amto and Zagma, residing in the village of Govav. Dgma Amto is still alive. I have transcribed both these stories and they have been incorporated into the Nen corpus."><sup>1</sup></a>.

<h2 id="source-of-data">Source of the data</h2>

All material in this dictionary was collected by the primary author during annual fieldtrips between 2008 and 2018, totalling approximately ten months. The vast bulk was recorded in Bimadbn village itself, but additional material was collected in surrounding garden hamlets (e.g. Zeri), neighbouring villages (e.g. Govav, Dimsisi), the small local centre known as Morehead Station, in the provincial capital of Daru, and during travel by dinghy, bicycle, on foot and (occasionally) in the back of a truck between these locations.

The dictionary remains provisional and incomplete but this version is being published so as to provide a resource for community members, and scholars from a range of backgrounds, wanting to learn something about the vocabulary of this fascinating language.

Over the eleven years of fieldwork, different emphases, reflecting different patterns of project funding, led to the elaboration of particular parts of the dictionary. After two years’ initial support from a Professorial setup grant at the Australian National University, I received outside grant funding between 2010 and 2015 from two further agencies, the Australian Research Council (Grant: Languages of Southern New Guinea) and the DoBeS Program (Dokumentation bedrohter Sprachen) of the Volkswagenstiftung. The focus of the first of these was on building up descriptive materials on Nen and related languages; working in a team with linguists working on other languages of Southern New Guinea (Jeff Siegel on Nama, Christian Döhler on Komnzo, Wayan Arka on Marori and Matt Carroll on Ngkolmpu) meant that many ideas about likely lexicalisations were passed back and forth, opening up detailed lines of enquiry. The second on wide-ranging naturalistic documentation with particular focus on ethnobotany (drawing on the botanical expertise of Kipiro Damas of the PNG National Herbarium) and ethnoornithology (drawing on the deep knowledge of birds and ethnobiology of another project participant, Dr Chris Healey. Particularly from the inception of the DoBeS project, and thanks to the extra participation of Julia Miller, the Nen documentation project began building a collection of audio and video files illustrating a wide variety of traditional activities and aspects of modern life. Initially these were archived in the DoBeS archive but more recently all Nen media files and transcriptions have started being lodged in the Digital Archive Paradisec. I also investigated Nen valency patterns in detail as part of the Leipzig Valency Classes Project, using a questionnaire  developed by Andrej Malchukov, Iren Hartmann, Martin Haspelmath, Bernard Comrie and Søren Wichmann. Since 2014 my fieldtrips have been supported by the Australian Research Council Laureate Project ‘Wellsprings of Linguistic Diversity’, which focuses on variation in small-scale speech communities – at this point recordings began to be made across a much wider range of speakers, mostly through interviews by Nen speakers. It must be emphasised that all of the above activities have generated a vast collection of recordings, of which only a small part has been transcribed (so far around 30,000 words), and even within that corpus not all words or usages have been incorporated into this dictionary.

Apart from the changing foci mentioned above, a wide range of techniques have been used to extend and refine the vocabulary recorded here: elicitation of word lists as an initial method, collection of plant specimens (with Kipiro Damas) and identification of birds from sightings and calls (with Chris Healey), excerpting of vocabulary from recorded materials and transcriptions, talking about the physical and social environment as we moved through it on visits to yam gardens, hamlets and special sites, and most importantly simple participant observation as Nen people have tried to teach me the intricacies of their language. As befits a multilingual society where it is normal for people to be regularly learning new languages, Nen speakers have clear ideas about how this should be done, such as whispering in my ear what to say in answer to an anticipated question or command. In addition to that, many words arose during focussed discussions during sessions held most Sunday afternoons as part of my compact with the community to help them with their ambition of translating the Bible into Nen.

A word on neologisms: Nen speakers have an ideology that basically everything should be describable using the resources of the Nen language (notwithstanding a few loanwords), and see nothing amiss with adding in new coinages of various types, including botanical terms (when nobody could recall a term for a plant species they all agreed was distinct from another known by the same name), terms for professions (e.g. _wawapser_ for ‘teacher’, based on the verb _wawaps_ ‘to teach’), and terms for the institutions and techniques of the modern world, e.g. _sarnḡ_ ‘yamhouse’ gets extended to ‘bank’, and _sode_ ‘pile’  (also pronounced file in local English) gets extended to mean a file on a computer. Nen, like English or German, is a living language, and in line with community wishes such new coinages have been included in this dictionary.

Every year since 2010 I have produced an annual ‘dictionary harvest’, a printout of the provisional dictionary so far, and taken up some printouts on my field trip. During the field trip these would be passed around and annotated by a range of interested people such as Jimmy Nébni, Goe Dibod and Nébni Mkao, who would often borrow them overnight and read and mark them up by torchlight. (There is no power in the village). The efforts of these Nen lexicographers have done a great deal to render this more accurate than it would otherwise have been, though many mistakes undoubtedly remain to be resolved. Others such as Grmbo Blba, more interested in grammatical structures, would join me on my veranda after dark, taking me through notebooks they had filled with interesting homophones or similar-sounding words.

An indication of the community’s interest in this dictionary project comes from its enthusiasm in keeping track of the steady growth in the number of entries (and its commitment to help keep this expanding). In 2011 a large tree was cut down from the nearby forest and squared up to form a ‘dictionary pole’, erected in front of my house in the village. Each field trip the number of lexical entries recorded up to the previous year is carved into the side of the pole. Villagers take great pride in drawing this pole to the attention of visitors from other villages. As well as recording the number using Arabic numerals, the number of entries is also recorded using the Nen senary (base six) system (Evans 2009, and see below under specialties of vocabulary). To avoid confusion in how to interpret the digits – for example should 1000 be interpreted as one thousand or as 216 (six cubed), those to be interpreted as base six are written using the Devanagari numerals. For example, the interim number of dictionary entries recorded to 2010 – i.e. 2327, when written as a power of 6, is 2327 = 1 x 1296 (1 x 64 ) + 4 x 216 (4 x 63 ) + 4 x 36 (4 x 62 ) + 2 x 6 + 1. This was written as shown on the dictionary pole.

<h2 id="orthography">The orthography (writing system) and pronunciation</h2>

The writing system used in this dictionary is a practical orthography, developed by the author in consultation with the Nen speech community on the basis of an earlier orthography suggested by Boevé and Boevé (2000), with some modifications to be mentioned below. Apart from prenasalised obstruents, which are written with a nasal letter plus an obstruent, e.g. <i>mb</i>, <i>nd</i>, <i>nz</i>, all phonemes are represented by a single letter (grapheme) in the practical orthography, though there are a number of diacritics. See Evans & Miller (2016) for a detailed treatment of Nen phonetics.

Table 1 shows the inventory of consonants, using both phonetic letters and (in square brackets) the graphemes of the practical writing system. Apart from &lt;nz&gt; and &lt;z&gt;, each of which allows a number of equally-accepted pronunciations, consonants do not exhibit significant variation in their pronunciation. Of particular note is the labial-velar series, where e.g. a _k_ and _p_ are produced at the same time (as in West African languages like Igbo).<a href="#ref2" id="2" data-toggle="tooltip" title="In the Boevé and Boevé orthography these were written as kw, gw and ngw. but these are poor representations of the phonetics. Neither kw or kp (and likewise for other sequences) are possible graphemic representations if one adopts the epenthetic-schwa analysis used here, since in both cases these are possible two-consonant sequences with schwas inserted between them."><sup>2</sup></a> The <i>h</i> phoneme is marginal and found only in a few interactive words (like _ahã_ ‘here you are!’) and some English loan words like _hedmasta_ ‘headmaster’ or _hos_ ‘horse’, though in such words many speakers drop the h and pronounce them as _edmasta_ or _os_.

*Table 1.* Consonant phonemes (//) and their corresponding graphemes (< >) in the Nen orthography; significant allophones shown in [] where they deviate from the IPA symbol for the phoneme

With regard to vowels, there are six main full vowels, plus two short vowels, as well as two nasalised vowels with very marginal status (each confined to a few interactional words like _gẽhẽ_ ‘over there’, _ẽ_ ‘yes’ and _ahã_ ‘here you are!’). These are shown in Table 2:

_Table 2_. Vowel phonemes (//) and their corresponding graphemes (< >). Note that most of the time the ə is predictable and is not written (see below).

Short vowels have a complex phonology. <é> (/ɩ/) is short and lower and more central than /i/, though articulated more tensely than the IPA symbol would normally suggest.  It can neither begin nor end a word, though it can begin a root (e.g. _-égérngr_ ‘be away (non-dual)’, as in yégérngr /jɩgɩrŋgr/ ‘(s)he is away’, where y- is the third person subject prefix. When flanked by a consonantal onset and nucleus it contrasts phonemically with other vowels – as shown by minimal pairs contrasting it with /e/ and /i/, as well as with syllabic /r/:  <beneba> /beneba/ ‘with a window’ vs <bénba> /bɩnba/ [bɩnɩ̥ba] ‘with a smile’,  <dénḡ> /dɩŋ͡mg͡bw/ ‘bamboo pipe’ vs <dinḡ> /diŋ͡mg͡bw/ ‘OK, I’ll see him’, <qrqr> / k͡pwṛk͡pwṛ/ ‘diarrhoea’ vs  <qérqér> /k͡pwɩrk͡pwɩr/ ‘bushfire’, <kr> /kr/ ‘dead’ vs <kérbér> /kɩrbɩr/ ‘cold’.

A voiceless “echo”  version of this vowel is common after monosyllabic stems in which the vowel occurs, if they end in a voiced stop, e.g. <péd> /pɩd/ [pɩdɩ̥] ‘end (of something, e.g. a rope)’,<bénba> /bɩnba/ [bɩnɩ̥ba] ‘with a  smile’. Speakers are emphatic about not wanting to write such echo vowels, which are phonologically predictable. A final quirk of /ɩ/ is that it conditions harmonic epenthesis (see below on vowel epenthesis): if a lexical /ɩ/ is present at some point in the word, other epenthetic vowels will be realised as [ɩ] rather than [ə].

/ə/ ( [ə] ~ [ɐ]) is the most complex vowel analytically. In most cases phonetic schwa results from epenthesis and is not phonemic– essentially phonetic schwa is used to fill in the nuclei of syllables to which no vocalic or liquid segment is linked, e.g. <kp>  /kp/ [kəp]. However, there some phonotactic positions in which schwa does not result from epenthetic insertion, and in such cases it is written with the grapheme <á>: word-initially in a couple of words (e.g. <ábṛməs> and in a couple of open monosyllables (e.g. <má>  /mə/ ‘still’).<a href="#ref3" id="3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="[ə] or [ɐ] can also be a realisation of unstressed word-initial /a/, in verbs where the stress falls on the root away from the diathetic prefix, e.g. /ətors/ ‘exit’. Speakers prefer to write this as &lt;a&gt;."><sup>3</sup></a> To deal with such words, we need to retain schwa as a phoneme in its own right, even though the vast majority of phonetic schwas are epenthetic and non-phonemic.

To help readers insert this vowel correctly – particularly given the long strings of consonants the reader will be puzzled to encounter in this dictionary – here are the rules governing schwa epenthesis:

<ol>
<li>Associate each specified vowel with a syllable nucleus.</li>
<li>In word-final position, and some other final positions (of reduplicate elements, compounds, verb stems, and boundaries before case affixes) associate the last consonant with a coda position.</li>
<li>For the remaining segments in the word, maximize onsets, in other words associate as many consonants as possible are associated with onset position. Exception: the clusters /Sr/, /Sl/, /NSr/ (where S is a stop, and NS a prenasalised stop), /sp/ and /sk/ are syllabified as complex onsets before following associated vowels, e.g. &lt;spélnḡ&gt; [spɪlɪŋg͡bw] ‘basket’, &lt;skop&gt; [skop] ‘eye’, &lt;drondro&gt; [drondro] ‘night carpenter bird’.</li>
<li>Associate any unassociated liquid segments (<i>r</i> or <i>l</i>) which directly follow consonants to nucleus slots.</li>
<li>Likewise reassociate the nasal element of any NS cluster that is not in word-initial position to the preceding coda.</li>
<li>Fill any unassociated nucleus slots with an epenthetic [ə]. If the immediately preceding vowel is /ɩ/, make the epenthetic vowel [ɩ] instead of [ə].</li>
</ol>

These principles can be illustrated with the following examples:
&lt;kanam&gt; /kanam/ ‘snake’  > [ka.nam]
&lt;knm&gt; /knm/ ‘come!’ > [kə.nəm ~ kə.nṃ]
&lt;nnam&gt; /nnam/ ‘come (later)!’  >  [nə.nam]
&lt;argban&gt; /argban/ ‘Tree species: Acacia mangium’ > [a.rə.gə.ban]
&lt;Kokottkape&gt;  /Kokottkape/ ‘place name’ > [kokotətəkape]
&lt;wañmst&gt; waɲm-s-t/ ‘to close’ /waɲm-s-t/>  [wa.ñəm.sət ~ wa.ñṃ.sət]
&lt;sakrdbnmne&gt; /sakrdbnmne/ ‘from the trunk of the sakr palm’ > (sakr-dbn-mne [palm-stem-<font style="font-feature-settings: 'smcp'">ORG</font>] [sa.kr.dəbən.məne ~ sa.kr.dəbṇ.məne])
&lt;kr&gt; /kr/ ‘death, dead’  > [kr̩]

<h2 id="main-features">Main features of the Nen language</h2>

We do not include a sketch grammar here, since a full grammar of Nen is in preparation. Rather, this section is intended to give the reader enough understanding of the language to understand the structuring of the dictionary. A better understanding can be gained from the following articles or chapters dealing with specific aspects of the language: Evans (2014) on positional verbs, Evans (2015a) on valency, Evans (2015b) on inflection, Evans (2017) on quantifiers, Evans (2019) on the complex four-valued number system, and the sketch on pp. 685-690 of Evans et al (2017) for a somewhat more detailed overview than is given here.

Main linguistic features:
<ol type="a">
<li>Verb final, as the unmarked (though not the only) phrase order.</li>
<li>Subject before object unless the object is human and the subject is not.</li>
<li>Complex morphology on both nouns and verbs. Transitive verbs, in particular, have paradigms with several thousand cells.</li>
<li>A complex system of grammatical relations, in which case-marking on NPs is ergative/absolutive, agreement on verbs is ‘split-S’, with intransitive arguments indexed by prefix on stative verbs and by suffix on dynamic verbs (regardless of agentivity), and grammatical relations (subject, object, indirect object) are composed by integrating case-marking, verbal indexation and other syntactic behaviours.</li>
<li><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Distributed exponence</span> (Carroll 2017) in the verb, which means that most inflectional values (person and number of subject and object, tense, aspect, mood) require the integration of multiple sites on the verb, and even of the verb with free pronouns, for their full interpretation, and that conversely what looks like the same form can have different meanings in different combinations.</li>
<li>A rich set of <span style="font-variant: small-caps">diathetic prefixes</span> to the verb, which can either increase their valency (causative, benefactive) or decrease it (reflexive, reciprocal, decausative). Occasionally verbs take more than one such diathetic prefix, sometimes accruing rather idiomatic meanings in the process, e.g. <i>aebyängs</i> ‘to fly (e.g. birds)’, <i>waebyängs</i> ‘to make fly (e.g. a pilot flying a plane)’, <i>awaebyängs</i> ‘1. to swat flies off one’s body, i.e. to make them fly away from oneself; 2. to wait’. Addition of a further benefactive prefix to this latter gives the word <i>wawaebyängs</i> 'to wait for'. Entries from such <span style="font-variant: small-caps">diathetic families</span> are linked in the dictionary by the label <span style="font-variant: small-caps">codiathetic</span>, which points to its neighbouring kin in the family chain, e.g. the entry for <i>awaebyängs</i> specifies ‘codiathetic: <i>waebyängs</i>, wawaebyängs’ and the entry for <i>aebyängs</i> specifies .‘codiathetic: waebyängs’. By following these chains of diathetic links, families of verbs related by valency-chaining derivation can be recovered from the dictionary.</li><li>No serial verbs (unlike Papuan languages of the Trans-New Guinea phylum), but widespread use of infinitives inflected for case in various sorts of complex constructions, e.g. <i>onest</i> ‘(in order) to fish with a net’  is built from the infinitive <i>ones</i> ‘to fish with a net’ by adding the allative case suffix <i>-t</i>; ones is itself built from the stem <i>one</i>.</li>
<li>A <span style="font-variant: small-caps">composed</span> number system that has either three values (most transitive subjects: singular, dual, plural) or four (objects and intransitive subjects: singular, dual, plural, large plural), and that is unusual in the way that it derives plurals by combining a <span style="font-variant: small-caps">non-dual</span> (i.e. some number other than two) with a <span style="font-variant: small-caps">non-singular</span> – consider how the prefixes <i>y-</i> ‘3<sup>rd</sup> person singular: he, she’ and <i>yä-</i> ‘3<sup>rd</sup> person non-singular: they’ combine with the stems <i>-kmangr</i> ‘to be lying down (non-dual)’ and <i>-kmaran</i> ‘to be lying down (dual)’ we get the forms <i>ykmangr</i> ‘(s)he is lying down’, <i>yäkmaran</i> ‘they two are lying down’ and <i>yäkmangr</i> ‘they (more than two) are lying down’. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps">large plural</span> is composed by a baffling variety of means, according to the type of verb, and rather than treat this complex subject here the reader is referred to Evans (2019). Although in many verbs the dual vs non-dual contrast is shown by a regular <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thematic</span> between the stem and the tense/aspect/mood/subject suffix, there are also many verbs showing more irregular alternations and these are flagged in the dictionary by the labels <span style="font-variant: small-caps">dual</span> or <span style="font-variant: small-caps">non-dual</span> pointing to the other form.</li>
<li>Most verbs in Nen – and the set is large, at around 1,417 out of 5,005 lexical items – employ single words (inflected or infinitive, as appropriate) with no further material. As mentioned in (f), there are many families linked by diathetic prefixes of various sorts, and there are also alternations between stative ‘positional verbs’ like <i>éser</i> ‘to be in water, to be immersed’, causatives like <i>wésers</i> ‘to put in water’, and dynamic middle verbs like <i>esers</i> ‘to come to be in water, to become immersed’. Other than these, and the dual/non-dual stem alternations found with some verbs, there are no appreciable derivational relations between one verb stem and another. Nor are there morphological means for deriving verbs from adjectives or nouns – instead, inchoative predicates are formed by combining the noun or adjective with the middle verb <i>ämts</i> ‘to become’ (e.g. <i>néq-ba nämtenda</i> ‘he got angry; lit. anger-with he.became’) and causative predicates by combing the noun or adjective with <i>wets</i> ‘bring to an end, complete, make’, e.g. <i>snutis etndt</i> ‘they made it slippery’; lit. ‘slippery-only they.made.it’. A relatively small number of other meanings are expressed by the combination of a coverb (typically doubling as a noun) and a verb, e.g. ‘to call back to’ is normally expressed by the phrase <i>ke wawanḡs</i> [lit. ‘noise/shout answer.to’]. A rather larger number of phrasal constructions – running to several dozen – are <span style="font-variant: small-caps">experiencer object</span> constructions, expressing meanings like ‘to be hungry’: these combine a ‘stimulus noun’, inflected for the ergative, a verb like <i>räms</i> ‘to do’, and place the experiencer in the object role, e.g. <i>ynd gersäm wramte</i> ‘I am hungry’, lit. ‘me hunger-<span style="font-variant: small-caps">ergative</span> it.does.me’. Phrasal verbs are listed in the dictionary with the coverb or stimulus noun (inflected if required by the construction) followed by the infinitive of the verb, e.g. <i>gersäm räms</i> ‘be hungry, feel hungry’.</li>
</ol>

Most Nen verbs are simple rather than phrasal. Apart from diathetical alternations like intransitive/causative or transitive/reflexive, there are practically no derivational relationships turning one verb into another, or creating verbs from nouns or adjectives by morphological derivation. This is a property shared with the other Yam languages. It contrasts strongly with Trans-New Guinea languages such as Kalam (Pawley 1993, Pawley & Bulmer 2011), which have given many linguists the impression that it is typical for Papuan languages to have small sets of inflecting verbs and to compose the larger verb lexicon by combining a lexical verb with a coverb (sometimes called a ‘verb adjunct’ in the Papuanist literature).

<h2 id="special-information">Types of special information</h2>
<h3 id="headword-classifications">Headword classifications</h3>

After each headword, information is given about that word’s _part of speech_ or _word class_. Knowing this gives a summary of how that word behaves grammatically, since parts of speech are _classes of words that show the same essential grammatical behaviour_.

For example, knowing that a word is a <span style="font-variant: small-caps">middle verb</span>, we know that its first prefix slot will normally be filled with one of the prefixes, _n_, _k_ or _g_ (working together with the suffix to express tense, aspect and mood), and that it will take <span style="font-variant: small-caps">actor</span> suffixes. For example the middle verb _owabs_ ‘speak, say, talk’, occurs in such forms (among hundreds) as _nowabm_ ‘we two are talking’, _nowabtam_ ‘we (several) are talking’, _kowabte_ ‘you (singular) were or (s)he was talking yesterday’, and _gowabte_ ‘you (singular) were or (s)he was talking a long time ago’. At the same time, knowing that a verb is middle also tells us that its subject will be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">absolutive</span> case (taking no suffixes), rather than the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">ergative</span> case found with transitive subjects: <i>dmab nowabte</i> ‘(the) woman is talking’ is correct, but it would be incorrect to say *_dmabm nowabte_, adding ergative <i>-m</i> to the word for ‘woman’. From knowing a verb is middle, we also know that when it combines with a <span style="font-variant: small-caps">phasal auxiliary</span> (words like ‘begin’, ‘finish’ and so on) that phasal auxiliary must itself be in the middle form, e.g. _opaps_ ‘begin (middle)’ rather than __wapaps__ ‘begin (transitive)’: _dmab owabst nopapnda_ ‘the woman has begun to talk’ is built by adding the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">allative</span> suffix _-t_ to the infinitive _owabs_ to give _owabst_, and combining this with the inflected phasal auxiliary verb _opaps_, middle form, third person singular past perfective, which is _nopapnda_ ‘(s)he began’.

Contrasting this briefly with a ‘transitive verb’ like _renzas_ ‘carry’, if we know a verb is transitive we know that it will take prefixes from the ‘undergoer’ series denoting its object, and suffixes from the ‘actor’ series denoting its subject. Its subject will take the ergative case (instead of the absolutive case used with a middle verb) and its object will take the absolutive case. And if it combines with a phasal verb, then the phasal verb must be transitive. We can illustrate this with _yrenzm_, ‘we two are carrying it’, _yrenzam_ ‘we (several) are carrying it’, _yrenze_ ‘(s)he is carrying it, you (singular) are carrying it’, _trenzam_ ‘we (several) carried it yesterday’, and _drenzawm_ ‘we (several) carried it a long time ago’. Combining with two nouns to illustrate the behaviour of case suffixes, we have _dmabm yép yrenze_ ‘the woman is carrying the basket’, with ergative _-m_ now on the noun _dmab_ ‘woman’ to indicate she is doing something to something else. And combining with _wapaps_ ‘begin (something)’ (as opposed to the middle form _opaps_ ‘begin’) we can make sentences like _dmabm yép renzast yapapnda_ ‘the woman began to carry the basket’ built by adding the allative suffix _-t_ to the infinitive _renzas_, building _renzast_ ‘to carry’, and combining with the inflected phasal auxiliary _yapapnda_ ‘(s)he began it’.

These two examples illustrate the purpose of giving word class information after a word: the headword (e.g. _owabs_ or _renzas_) tells you how the word is pronounced, the definition (e.g. ‘speak, talk’ or ‘carry’ tells you what it means, and the word class information tells you about how it is used in the grammar, including the changes of form it undergoes, and how it combines with oher words to form phrases and sentences. In the case of middle and transitive verbs, there is even a phonological difference: the infinitives and stems of middle verbs are vowel-initial, and those of transitive verbs begin with consonants.

Usually word classes form predictable clusters of meaning (e.g. nouns designate things, verbs designate actions etc.), but these are not always equivalent from one language to another. For example, the word _know_ is a verb in English, but its Nen meaning-equivalent mete is a <span style="font-variant: small-caps">predicate adjective</span>, behaving more like the English word ‘knowledgable’ in its grammar: to translate ‘I know, he knows’ into Nen you combine it with the respective forms of the verb ‘to be’, thus: _ynd_ [I] _mete wm_ (literally ‘I know(ledgeable) I-am’, _bä mete ym_ ‘(s)he know (s)he-is’ ‘(s)he know(ledgeable) (s)he-is’.

A final point about word classes: some words are <span style="font-variant: small-caps">heterosemous</span> and can belong to more than one word class, according to the precise meaning. (English does this too: _green_ can be both an adjective, as in _a green leaf,_ and a noun, as in _I like green_, and kiss can be both a verb, as in _They are kissing_, and a noun, as in _She gave him a tender kiss_). Nen is less radical than English here – it is not possible to zip back and forth between nouns and verbs as in English – but there are pockets of words that regularly have more than one word class, particularly a rather large set of words that can be both abstract nouns and adjectives: _brbr_ ‘fear, shame, shyness (noun); afraid, frightened (adjective)’, _qébti ‘dark_ (adjective); darkness (noun), night, nightfall (noun)’, _kr_ ‘death; dead, the late’. It appears that conversion between adjective and noun classes can go in both directions – a word like _qébti_ includes the suffix _-ti_, an allomorph of _-te_ ‘having, characterised by’ which regularly derives adjectives from nouns (cf _sn_ ‘tooth’, _snte_ ‘sharp’), plus the noun root _qéb_ ‘shade, darkness’, while with other words the evidence of families of derivates points in the other direction – the curse word _kraba_ 'blast! geez!' is formed by adding the comitative _-(a)ba_ to _kr_, i.e. ‘by death!’, and _-aba_ is a suffix on nouns, not adjectives. In heterosemous (and also in polysemous) entries I follow the order which seems most likely in terms of semantic and formal derivation, which means that the relative order of noun and adjective senses is not consistent.

In the table that follows, I list the word class labels given in the dictionary, along with a brief explanation of the main characteristics of that word class. I group the word classes into main types (e.g. verbs, pronouns, adverbs) and then deal with different subtypes (e.g. middle verbs, transitive verbs).

<td>experiencer object verb</td>
<td><p>Combines a ‘stimulus noun phrase’ in the ergative (e.g. <i>gersäm</i>, the ergative of <i>gers</i> ‘hungry; hunger’) with a transitive verb (most commonly <i>räms</i> ‘do to’ and the experiencer in the absolutive. As would be expected from their case roles, the stimulus is indexed by the actor suffix and the experiencer by the undergoer prefix. Word order is normally: experiencer (absolutive) stimulus (ergative) verb, e.g. <i>ynd gersäm wramte</i> [me hunger-ERG me-does-it] ‘I am hungry’ . Analysed as having the experiencer as phrasal verbs with a fixed (transitive) subject and an open object, the experiencer, with the word order reflecting a preference for humans rather than non-humans to come first.</p>
<p>In the dictionary, experiencer objects are treated as phrasal verbs, given in the form N-ERG V(INFINITIVE), e.g the above example is entered as <i>gersäm räms</i> (experiencer object verb) ‘be hungry, feel hungry’</p></td>
<td>Physical sensation like ‘be itchy’, ‘be hungry’, ‘be thirsty’, and emotions like ‘be friustrated’.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>verb</td>
<td>intransitive verb</td>
<td><p>For Nen this is used in a rather restrictive way, being confined to verbs which index just one argument, using prefixes for person and number (though supplemented by suffixes for dual vs non-dual in the case of positionals, which are a subclass of intransitive verbs). Intransitive verbs thus have their sole argument in the absolutive case, and indexed by undergoer prefix. A further peculiarity of intransitive verbs is that they have no infinitives, apart from ‘go’, which has the suppletive infinitive <i>yls</i>, formally unrelated to any finite form of the root. The commonest intransitive verb is the copula ‘to be’ and its two derivatives ‘come’ and ‘go’, formed by prefixing it for the respective directionals (‘come’ is thus ‘be hither’). Other than these, and the verb ‘walk’, all other intransitives belong to the subclass of ‘positionals’ (see below), which has about forty-five members.</p>
<p>Lexicographically it is problematic to select which form to use for the lemma heading of intransitive verbs, since (unlike with the thousand or so other verbs) there is no infinitive. The solution here is to give the root (for the copula and ‘walk) or root + stative suffix (for positionals) followed by the symbol ‘^’ to indicate it cannot occur alone, e.g. <i>m^</i> ‘be’, <i>erengr^</i> ‘sit’. Suppletive dual roots are listed separately, e.g. <i>ren^</i> ‘be (of two)’. This is not a great solution, since Nen speakers do not recognise these as words, but so far no better solution has been found.</p></td>
<td>Stative situations (‘be’, ‘be in position’ [many different positions and postures are expressed by different verbs]. However, ‘come’ and ‘go’, formed from ‘be’ by adding directionals, are non-stative members of this class, as is the verb ‘walk’.</td>

<td>Take a middle prefix (<i>n</i>-, <i>k</i>- or <i>g</i>- according to tense, aspect and mood), an actor suffix, have their subject in the absolutive, and form phasal constructions with middle auxiliaries. ‘Intrinsic’  middle verbs are not formed by a clear semantic derivation<a href="#ref4" id="4" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Though there may be more idiosyncratic relationships, as between wabs ‘count’ and owabs ‘talk’ – cf English count and recount, and German zählen ‘count’ and erzählen ‘tell, recount’."><sup>4</sup></a> from any other verb</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>verb</td>
<td>phasal auxiliary</td>
<td>Indicate action ‘phases’, such as beginning, continuing or ending; the verb they modify is placed in an infinitive plus a case suffix, and the phasal auxiliary must match the infinitive in transitivity. The phasal auxiliary carries all the inflectional categories that would have appeared on the main verb if it had been finite – person and number of subject and object, direction, and tense, aspect and mood</td>
<td>Half a dozen verbs denoting phasal transitions or continuations, normally with three diathetically linked versions to go with middle, transitive and ditransitive infinitives</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>verb</td>
<td>positional verb</td>
<td>This is the largest subclass of intransitive verbs. These are prefixing verbs and have special morphological properties, taking a special ‘stative’ suffix -<i>ngr</i> (non-dual) or -<i>aran</i> (dual) not found with other verbs, and, uniquely, form their ‘large plurals’ by combining singular prefixes with dual stative suffixes. They cannot take standard imperatives but can take future imperatives. Each positional verb belongs to a set of three linked lexemes: the positional verb, denoting ‘be in a position’ e.g. ‘be sitting’, the middle verb, denoting ‘get into a position’ (e.g. ‘sit down, get into a sitting position’) and the transitive verb, denoting ‘cause to be in a position’, (e.g. ‘cause to be in a sitting position, place (something), seat (someone)’.</td>
<td>Denotes positions (e.g. ‘be in a tree fork’ or postures (e.g. ‘be sitting’); there are around 45 of these. Many tightly define the figure: ground relations, e.g. ‘be in water’, ‘be wedged into something tight’. See Evans (2014).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>verb</td>
<td>reflexive/reciprocal verb</td>
<td>a type of middle verb, derived from a transitive verb by the addition of a diathetic prefix comprising an initial vowel (<i>a-, ä-, e-, i-</i>), that indicates action directed back at the initiator (reflexive) or back and forth between two or more parties (reciprocal). With plural subjects, the verb does not distinguish reflexive and reciprocal readings</td>
<td>Productively applied to form verbs where a reflexive or reciprocal relationship is appropriate. Unlike English, which has some ‘naturally reciprocal verbs’ with no overt marking (e.g. ‘they kissed’, as well as ‘naturally reflexive verbs’ (e.g. ‘he shaved’), all reflexive and reciprocal actions are overtly marked as such through the addition of a diathetic prefix to a transitive (or ditransitive) base.</td>

<td>semi-transitive verb</td>
<td>Morphologically, these look like transitive verbs, indexing both subject and object, but they assign case according to an absolutive:dative frame instead of the ergative:absolutive frame that is found with transitive verbs.</td>
<td>A small set of verbs which involve two participants but where the effect on the second participant is rather indirect, including ‘help’, ‘teach’, ‘load onto’, ‘wait in prey for’.</td>

I thank the following organisations for financial support of my work on Nen: the Australian Research Council (Grants: Languages of Southern New Guinea and The Wellsprings of Linguistic Diversity), the Volkswagen Foundation (DoBES project ‘Nen and Tonda’), the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Anneliese Maier Forschungspreis), the Australian National University (Professorial Setup Grant) and the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language (CoEDL). Most importantly, I think the entire population of Bimadbn village for their hospitality and friendship, particularly those members of the language and clan committee whose names listed above. Discussions from various colleagues working on other languages of Southern New Guinea have aided immensely in coming to understand what, at the beginning of 2008, was virtually a completely undocumented language family: Marco and Alma Boevé, Matt Carroll, Kipiro Damas, Christian Döhler, Chris Healey, Darja Hoenigman, Penny Johnson, Eri Kashima, Julia Miller, Jeff Siegel. 

Discussions about languages of the neighbouring Pahoturi family, from which Nen has borrowed a number of words, have also been helpful, and here I thank Volker Gast, Kate Lindsey and Dineke Schokkin. 

Saliha Muradoǧlu has been of great assistance in helping organise and update the data in my Flex files. Finally, I would like to thank the Dictionaria Team – Iren Hartmann and Martin Haspelmath – both for their kind invitation to publish this (still very provisional and imperfect) dictionary in their series, for their editorial comments and corrections, and for their assistance in preparing it for publication in the current format.
